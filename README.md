# Nuclear Energy and Carbon Intensity

A short excercise of linear regression and data visualization.
This dataset has been acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption

## Possible correlation

The more Nuclear energy a country produces, the more contamination there is? Or maybe it is not true.
This study comprises the all year in the 21st century and test whether there are some correlation between nuclear energy share and the carbon intensity 
in the countries that apply.

At the end, an animated GIF shows all linear regressions made for these two variables. To provide more information, the radii of the markers in the scatterplot are 
proportional to the total energy consumption of the respective country.

For all years in the 21st century, the linear regression shows a NEGATIVE slope. The more nuclear energy there is in the energy matrix of the country, the less its
carbon intensity. As usual, we must remember that correlation does not imply causation. Nevertheless, this can be an argument to convince people that doubt about how clean nuclear energy is.

At the end, pvalues of for every year's regression are printed.
